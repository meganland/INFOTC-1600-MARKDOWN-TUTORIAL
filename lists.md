# Lists

There are two types of lists you can create in Markdown: unordered and ordered.

## Unordered List

To create an unordered list, you must start a line with the plus key ( + ), the dash key ( - ), or the asterisk key ( * ).

Example:

```
+ This is a list started with the plus key
+ This is another addition to the list
+ This is a third addition
```

Outputs:
+ This is a list started with the plus key
+ This is another addition to the list
+ This is a third addition

Note: Each marker character change forces a new list to start.

```
- this list has started with the dash key
* since this list was started with the asterisk key, a new list has been formed
+ very simple!
```
## Ordered List

For an ordered list, simply put the number plus a period in front of your text.

Example

```
1. This is the first item in the list
2. This is the second item in the list
3. This is the third item in the list
```

Note: You can you sequential numbers, or keep all the numbers as one. EIther way, the ordered list will appear in numerical order.

Example:
```
1. This is the first item in the list
1. This is the second item in the list
1. This is the third item in the list
```

Outputs:

1. This is the first item in the list
1. This is the second item in the list
1. This is the third item in the list

---
Note: You can also begin your ordered list at any number and follow it with ones. Markdown will start with your given number and continue to count up.

Example:
```
98. This is this 98th item on your list
1. This is the 99th item on your list
1. This is the 100th item on your list.
```

Outputs:

98. This is this 98th item on your list
1. This is the 99th item on your list
1. This is the 100th item on your list.
