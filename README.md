# Introduction to Markdown
## By: Megan Land

This tutorial is set up to teach students the markup language of Markdown. After this tutorial, students will be able to create a Markdown page with basic features including emphasis, images, and lists. 

My target audience is anyone who needs to write in Markdown for documentation, but do not have any experience with markup languages. This target audience does not require a specific age.
